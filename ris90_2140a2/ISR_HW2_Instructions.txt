Use any Python IDE and open the "Python" folder. 

* Libraries to install:
nltk

* Steps to follow:
1. Create a data folder in the same directory as of HW2Main.py
2. Save the following documents in their respective folders:
* 	Save result.trectext and result.trecweb  in the data folder
3. Create 2 folders inside the data folder:
* 	indextext: This folder will store the index files for the trectext file
* 	indexweb: This folder will store the index files for the trecweb file
4. Directly run Ô'HW2Main.py' file
5. Once Ô'HW2Main.py' file is compiled 2 Index files will be added  in each of the above 2 directories.

* Note: 
In HW2Main.py, I have modified code in line 49 & 51 as it was syntactically incorrect.
* Line 53 
	Original Code: ReadIndex("trecweb", "yhoo")
      	Modified Code: ReadIndex("trectext", "yhoo")
* Line 51 
	Original Code: print ("index web corpus running time: ", endTime - startTime)
      	Modified Code: print ("index text corpus running time: ", endTime - startTime)

* Note on Running Time:
* trecweb: Index web took approximately 2minutes to run the corpus and approximately 7 seconds to load and retrieve the token
o 	index web corpus running time:  0:02:14.701897
o 	load index & retrieve the token running time:  0:00:06.500940
* trectext: Index web took approximately 2minutes to run the corpus and approximately 7 seconds to load and retrieve the token
o 	index text corpus running time:  0:09:21.442980
o 	load index & retrieve the token running time:  0:00:34.430315
